skySMP - SkyBlock Survival Multiplayer Implementation:
Version: v0.1.1

Multiplayer implementation of the popular SkyBlock Survival map.
This mod adds commands for users to generate their own Island to survive on
in the sky. Every player can have exactly one island (and reset it if he
feels like starting over). Try to survive with only minimal resources and
complete the challenges.


Usage: 
The plugin can be installed on any World, however it is recommended to run it
on a dedicated world in "pure mode". If you wish to use the plugin on a
regular world , just copy the .jar to /plugins/ and you are good to go.

Pure Mode
In pure mode, no map except for a spawn area and the islands is ever generated.
This means that players cannot go on land to 'cheat'. It also looks a lot better
in my opinion. To use the plugin in pure mode, just follow these easy instructions:
1. Copy the plugin to /plugin/ like usual
2. get cleanroomGenerator and also copy it to the bukkit plugin folder
3. add this to the end of your bukkit.yml[CODE]worlds:

    skyIsland:

        generator: CleanroomGenerator:.[/CODE]

4. change level-name in server.properies to "skyIsland" and allow-flight to "true"

(the world _must_ be named skyIsland, if it is not the plugin will not

generate a spawn location)

Features:
[*] Able to create a complete Island for every player
[*] OP command to delete Islands of player
[*] Automatically arranges islands in space and fill spots of deleted islands
[*] On death, players are brought back to their islands or can go back any time with /tphome
[*] Works with cleanroomGenerator to create a "pure" SkyBlock World
